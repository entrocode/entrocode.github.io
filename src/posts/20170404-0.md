# ng-conf

Today was a workshop day for ng-conf.  The conference-proper starts tomorrow, but I went to a session on **Deploying Angular (2.x+) Apps to Production**.  It focused mostly on performance, which I found very helpful.

## ng eject

I've hesitated using ng-cli, but now that I know about `ng eject` to *eject* the webpack configuration and skip the cli aspect of it (allowing full customization), I think I'll be using it more in the future.
