# Whirlwind

Today was a whirlwind of great talks at ng-conf.  I noticed quite a few presenters were Google Developer Experts... I want to look into what that means / how to become one.

## Site stuff

I also noticed a few things about this site (which, is natural... it only being ~3 days old...)

* Need to fix responsiveness
* I'm wondering if I need to do something with ngrx / redux / state management
