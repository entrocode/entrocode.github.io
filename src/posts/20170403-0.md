# Markdown FTW

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Github Pages

For user pages the code has to be in the master branch at root level (annoying).  While not ideal... I can run `ng build` followed by `mv dist/* .` and that will move the built project into root and get served at [https://entrocode.github.io/](https://entrocode.github.io).  Later I'll point my custom domain to that.

## What's up with this, anyways?

I'm planning on using this as a blog.  Since I'm an Angular dev (and there aren't any good angular blogging platforms) I thought it'd be a fun little experiment to make one.  I have plenty of servers so I could host it on one of those, but a front-end only solution seems fun/fine for now.  If I get to the point where I add in 3rd party services then I'll move it.  With no backend I'll obviously be making some compromises... I'll try and track those here.
